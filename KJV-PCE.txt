Ge 1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
Ge 1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
Ge 1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
Ge 1:27 So God created man in his [own] image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
Ge 1:31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, [it was] very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
